## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### ❌ **"Python not found" Error**
**Windows:**
- Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked
- Or manually add Python to PATH in System Environment Variables

**Linux:**
- Use `python3` instead of `python`
- Install with: `sudo apt install python3`

#### ❌ **"Tesseract not found" Error**
**Windows:**
- Reinstall Tesseract OCR
- Add `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR` to PATH

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng
```

#### ❌ **"Browser launch failed" Error**
```bash
# Reinstall browser support
playwright install-deps chromium
playwright install chromium
```

#### ❌ **"Permission denied" Error**
**Windows:**
- Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- Check antivirus isn't blocking the software

**Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x start_agent.py
# Or run with python directly
python start_agent.py
```

#### ❌ **"Module not found" Error**
```bash
# Activate environment first
# Windows:
survey_env\Scripts\activate

# Linux:
source survey_env/bin/activate

# Then reinstall requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs**: Look at `autonomous_survey_agent.log` for detailed error messages
2. **Use debug mode**: Run with `python start_agent.py --log-level DEBUG`
3. **Test environment**: Run `python start_agent.py --check-env`

## 🔒 Security and Safety

### Important Security Notes:

1. **Credential Protection**: Your passwords are encrypted and stored securely
2. **Session Management**: Browser sessions are saved to avoid repeated logins
3. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays prevent detection as a bot
4. **Human Simulation**: Realistic mouse movements and typing patterns
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling to avoid account issues

### Best Practices:

- ✅ Use strong, unique passwords for survey accounts
- ✅ Enable 2FA on survey accounts when possible
- ✅ Start with low task limits (1-2 concurrent surveys)
- ✅ Monitor the control panel regularly
- ✅ Keep your API keys private and secure
- ❌ Don't share your `.env` file with anyone
- ❌ Don't run too many concurrent tasks initially
